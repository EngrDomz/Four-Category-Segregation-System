This project called Four-Category-Segregation-System is a machine built and develop to segregate waste products automatically. By simply placing the object at the detection section, the machine will automatically analyze the type of waste it belongs to. It has an indicator of the reading and also if the transh bins are good to accept more objects or if it is already full. 

Upon reaching the maximum state of the trash bins, it will automatically send SMS notification to the waste manager and the specific type of waste will not be accepted anymore by the machine but for the other types, procecss will continue. 

Upon the event of black out, this machine still continue the process using a 12V battery supply charged by a 2000W solar panel. The process of changing from grid to battery supply is automated which means that the machine will automatically switch power supply upon the event of black outs.
